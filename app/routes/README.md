**What it does**

- first checks that request has not expired. if it has, a `403` is sent and delivery can't be approved
- can only be done by company, so it then makes sure the logged-in user doing this approval is the company that owns the request
- Check if the delivery exists, and that it is awaiting approval. if it doesn't, throws an error
- if valid, it updates the delivery status, and adds approval date, approver signature, and approver wallet address

### Claim reward for delivery

**Endpoint**

- `/deliveries/:id/rewards`

**Type**

- `POST`

**Params**

- `:id` - delivery ID

**Body Fields**

- `collector_wallet_address`: we use this to validate that the person trying to claim the reward for the delivery is the one who created it in the first place
- `requestId`: to verify that request has not expired before claiming delivery reward

**What it does**

To use this endpoint, I'd recommed first checking the `delivery.can_claim` property when you access `/deliveries/:id` on the page. If `can_claim` is true, then add the other required fields, and proceed with the endpoint.

Now, to what the endpoint does:

- first checks that request has not expired. if it has, a `403` is sent and delivery reward can't be claimed
- then, checks delivery expiry, just to be safe. if expired, it sets delivery status to expired and returns a `403` error
- makes sure the logged-in user claiming the reward for this delivery is the collector that set up the initial delivery. if it fails, a `403` eerror is returned
- check conditions for claiming
    - `delivery_status` is `DELIVERED`
    - `approver_signature` exists
    - delivery date is past 48 hours, (cool-off period has expired)
    - N.B - we DON'T check that signer address matches company address - since in `approveDelivery`, we've made sure the company adding the address is valid
- if any of the above checks fails, we push an error (`404` or `403`, depending on the specific condition).
- if delivery is valid for claim, run a  delivery is found, it adds the size, amount, and proof, sets the status to `DELIVERED`, and also adds delivery date

**Returns**
- `status: true`
- `delivery` object, with delivery details from DB
    - `delivery.collector`, which are the collector details
